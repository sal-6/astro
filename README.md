# Astro

Note: The hw3.py files are actually for hw4 :)

## Overview

Code was written for UMD ENAE 601 - Astrodynamics for the Spring Fall 2022 Semester. 

## Prerequisites

1. Python3

## Usage
Below are steps to use the code.

1. Clone the repo
2. Create a virtual environment
  1. `py -m venv venv`
3. Activate the environment
  1. `./venv/Scripts/activate`
4. Install dependencies
  1. From root dir `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
  2. TODO: MAKE A `requirements.txt`
5. I recommend performing an edittable install of the package for when code fixes are inevitably needed :)
  1. `py -m pip install -e .` from the root dir
